# Xylem India Hackathon - Plastic Solutions Showcase

Welcome to the official repository for the project developed by our team for the Xylem India Hackathon. Our website serves as a comprehensive platform dedicated to addressing the prevention and collection of both Macroplastics and Microplastics, with a focus on providing practical solutions for various use cases.

## Purpose and Focus

The primary purpose of our website is to offer quick and accessible solutions for plastic pollution. We emphasize the need for intervention at the local level and aim to guide individuals in preventing and collecting plastic debris in nearby water bodies. The focus is on gradual, localized efforts, recognizing the importance of community-driven initiatives.

## Nature of the Website

Positioned as a quick-fix solution, our website provides immediate guidance to individuals uncertain about the appropriate methods for debris collection. We understand the low-priority nature of the issue and advocate for localized efforts over urgent, large-scale interventions.

## User-Friendly Interface

Our website features a user-friendly interface designed for easy navigation. Interactive tools and guides facilitate a straightforward decision-making process, ensuring that users can quickly find practical solutions for plastic pollution in their vicinity.

## Local Relevance

Tailored to address the needs of diverse localities, our website takes into account geographical variations. It allows users to identify solutions best suited to their specific environment, promoting the adoption of context-specific strategies.

## Education and Awareness

A key aspect of our website is its role in educating users about different methods available for plastic debris prevention and collection. Users are empowered to make informed decisions based on their locality's unique challenges and characteristics, fostering a sense of environmental awareness.
